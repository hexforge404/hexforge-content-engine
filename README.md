**HexForgeRunner** is a PowerShell-based content automation tool designed for developers and creators who want to capture dev sessions, screen recordings, and terminal logs, then send them to a remote AI engine for blog and media generation.

Built as part of the **HexForge Content Automation Engine**, this Windows-side toolkit launches OBS, tracks your session, collects logs and video, and packages everything for upload and processing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* Launches labeled shell sessions with logging
* Integrates with OBS Studio for screen recording
* Monitors OBS to auto-stop capture
* Builds JSON blog metadata from session logs
* Sends session data to a remote engine via SCP
* Reusable project and part naming system
* Automated folder structure and asset management

## üß∞ Tech Stack

* PowerShell 5+ (Windows)
* OBS Studio
* SCP (OpenSSH or PuTTY)
* Remote Linux server with AI processing engine

## üß† Overview

The HexForge Content Automation Engine is a multi-part AI-powered pipeline that transforms screen-recorded development sessions into structured blogs, media packs, and Notion content blocks. The system includes:

* A dual-platform recording and packaging frontend (Windows + Linux)
* A processing backend hosted on Proxmox with AI toolchain integration
* Scripts for video + log ingestion, blog generation, voice narration, and asset export

## üíª Platform Components
